## 5. Requirments
In order to to run this project, you must have [Python3](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine. You also must have all listed libraries inside the `requirments.txt` so run the following command to install them: 
```
pip3 install -r requirments.txt
```

## 6. Running Process 
This secions explains how to run each part of this project using the command prompt or terminal

### A. Process Data
 Data Exploration and Data Visualization have been done in `process_data.ipynb` file which is inside the data folder

### B. Training the classifier
To re-train the classifier, you must go inside the `models` directory using the terminal or the command prompt and run the following:
```shell
python3 train_classifier.py ../data/<database_name>.db <model_name>.pkl
```

### C. Run the Flask Web App
To run the web app, you must go inside the `app` directory using the terminal or the command prompt and run the following:
```shell
python3 run.py
```
The link of the website will be `0.0.0.0:3001`
